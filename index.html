					It is a long term <mark style="background-color: #335789;  color: white;">Bootcamp of 3 months</mark>. ‚è≥
					Within this time, we'll discuss, share and learn as much as we can about IoT. 

					You can start anytime. From the day your required items are available, you'll be provided access to the <mark style="background-color: #335789;  color: white;">Training Resources and Videos</mark>. I'll give 3 hours of my time to you every week and train/guide you to build your IoT Projects <mark style="background-color: #335789;  color: white;">within the 3 months</mark>.üòé
					<br><br>
					üß∞It is mandatory to have a <mark style="background-color: #335789;  color: white;">list of Electronic Items</mark> (detail will be sent to the interested candidates). If you buy the items from any Online site or from nearby Electronic shop. It'll all be around <mark style="background-color: #335789;  color: white;">‚Çπ1500-1700</mark> which is your one-time investment. You can build IoT Projects, add IoT to your projects, and use the same equipment for other projects as well. This was the most important part, i.e. having <mark style="background-color: #335789;  color: white;">YOUR OWN COMPONENTS</mark>.
					<br><br>
					üì∂We'll cover mostly WiFi connected devices and mainly <mark style="background-color: #335789;  color: white;">ESP32/ESP8266 dev board</mark>. We'll also use Alexa, Google Home, Google Assistant to build Voice Appsüéô, then other technologies like Web Apps, Python Apps and use public APIs to gather huge <mark style="background-color: #335789;  color: white;">open source data</mark> and use them efficiently.üîå

		Briefly,<br>
		This Course would help you strengthen your core concepts as it will cover all the basics you need to know to get started with IoT, i.e. Basic coding, then Arduino IDE, discuss about various Dev boards, SoC, and theories and concepts. We'll start with ESP32 and its features, programming, webservers, IoT platforms, etc. We'll also do some Web Dev, Python, and also learn about APIs and how to use them, on Javascript and Python.

		You would also have a understanding on how to start with a project, and how to convert an Idea/concept into real project. 
		<br><br>
		Build projects based upon situation, and requirements, both local and cloud connected IoT systems.

		By the end, you will be trained enough of having an IoT system of yourself. Design an IoT system, and contribute to my Open Source IoT server to practice or build IoT projects.
		<br><br><br>
		All of this for a price of ‚Çπ500 per person. 
		If you have a referral, eg: a friend, or acquaintance. Then get a discount of 25% per person.

		Everything we discuss would be exclusively available to you for all times. We'll make sure the resources remain with you forever, so that you can use, modify and build on them even in future.

		Top performers and makers can get the chance and decide on contributing to my ESP32 REST server, by using it for practicing and mostly to store data on it.

		This bootcamp is applicable for students of Class 9 and above.
